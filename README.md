# Stripe Payment Gateway - Python Implementation
 A Simple Python CGI script for processing user payments for a website, using the <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a> payment gateway.

This script was originally made in PHP (the original can be found <a href="https://financesonline.com/how-to-do-payment-gateway-integration-in-php-java-and-c/">here</a>) but was translated into Python by me. I had many extra dependencies that required me to use Python instead of PHP on my website, so I made this script.

# Setup:

Get your Stripe API keys:



Collect the Publishable key and Secret key

Install the Python packages `stripe` and `mysql-connector-python`:

```
pip install stripe
```

```
pip install mysql-connector-python
```
